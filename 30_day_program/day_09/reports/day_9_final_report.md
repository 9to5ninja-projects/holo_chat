## 🔧 **Technical Improvements Implemented**

### **Enhanced Pattern Recognition**:
```python
# Before: Narrow, specific patterns
elif ("curious" in cue_text.lower() and "explore" in cue_text.lower() and "next" in cue_text.lower()):

# After: Broader, more inclusive patterns  
elif (any(word in cue_text.lower() for word in ["curious", "wonder", "explore", "discover", "fascinate", "interested"]) or 
      ("what do you think" in cue_text.lower()) or
      ("help me understand" in cue_text.lower()) or
      ("can you help" in cue_text.lower())):
```

### **Enhanced Response Methods**:
- **Curiosity Engine**: Added learning support and "what do you think" handling
- **Synthesis Engine**: Added pattern recognition, multi-domain problem solving
- **Context Integration**: Broader pattern matching for complex queries
