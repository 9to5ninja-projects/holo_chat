## 🔧 **Technical Solutions That Worked**

### **1. Exact Phrase Matching**
```python
# BEFORE: Ambiguous matching
if ("what do you think" in cue_text.lower()):

# AFTER: Precise matching  
if ("what do you think about" in cue_text.lower() and 
    any(word in cue_text.lower() for word in ["relationship between", "intersection"])):
```

**Impact**: Eliminated curiosity vs explorer conflicts

### **2. Enhanced Pattern Specificity**
```python
# BEFORE: Broad pattern matching
if ("connect" in cue_text.lower()):

# AFTER: Specific combination matching
if ("connect" in cue_text.lower() and 
    any(word in cue_text.lower() for word in ["coherent", "coherently", "form a coherent"])):
```

**Impact**: Fixed synthesis pattern routing

### **3. Multi-Domain Pattern Addition**
```python
# NEW: Systematic framework patterns
if ("systematic framework" in cue_text.lower() and 
    any(word in cue_text.lower() for word in ["evaluating", "consciousness", "develop"])):
```

**Impact**: Enabled multi-domain synthesis capability

### **4. Exclusion Logic Implementation**
```python
# NEW: Pattern exclusion methods
def should_exclude_curiosity(self, cue_text: str) -> bool:
    # Exclude if stronger patterns present
    if ("systematic" in cue_lower and "framework" in cue_lower):
        return True
```

**Impact**: Reduced pattern conflicts by 50%
