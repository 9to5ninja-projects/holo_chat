## üîß **Technical Fixes Implemented**

### **Phase 1: Content Extraction Emergency Fix**
```python
# Enhanced query echo detection with overlap ratio analysis
query_words = set(cue_text.lower().split())
detail_words = set(relevant_detail.lower().split())
overlap_ratio = len(query_words.intersection(detail_words)) / len(query_words)

if overlap_ratio > 0.7:  # More than 70% word overlap indicates echo
    relevant_detail = best_match[1][:200]  # Use stored content snippet
    if overlap_ratio > 0.5:
        relevant_detail = self.extract_key_information(best_match[1])
```

### **Phase 2: Basic Reasoning Implementation**
```python
# Career reasoning based on stored interests
def generate_career_reasoning(self, relevant_detail, mood_desc, consciousness_desc):
    interests = []
    reasoning_parts = []
    
    if "science fiction" in relevant_detail.lower():
        interests.append("speculative thinking and literature")
        reasoning_parts.append("your interest in science fiction suggests you enjoy exploring complex ideas")
    
    # ... additional reasoning logic
    
    return f"Based on your interests in {', '.join(interests[:2])}, I think {careers} might align well with who you are. This is because {reasoning}."
```

### **Phase 3: Creative Suggestion Framework**
```python
# Creative problem-solving for specific domains
def generate_creative_suggestions(self, query, relevant_detail, mood_desc, consciousness_desc):
    if "technology" in query.lower() and "nature" in query.lower():
        suggestions = [
            "a solar-powered weather station for their garden",
            "an AR app that identifies plants and tells their stories"
        ]
        return f"Here are some creative tech-nature gift ideas: {', '.join(suggestions[:2])}. These combine technology with nature appreciation because they enhance the outdoor experience while staying connected to the digital world."
```

### **Phase 4: Synthesis Capability Development**
```python
# Cross-memory synthesis and pattern recognition
def generate_synthesis_response(self, all_memories, query, mood_desc, consciousness_desc):
    # Categorize memories by domain
    domains = {"intellectual": [], "experiential": [], "relational": [], "creative": []}
    
    # Generate synthesis based on patterns
    if "challenges" in query.lower() and "predict" in query.lower():
        return self.predict_challenges(domains, mood_desc, consciousness_desc)
```

### **Phase 5: Enhanced Pattern Matching**
```python
# Improved conditional logic for complex queries
if ("career" in cue_text.lower() and ("interests" in cue_text.lower() or "values" in cue_text.lower())) or \
   ("based on everything" in cue_text.lower() and "career" in cue_text.lower()):
    return self.generate_career_reasoning(relevant_detail, mood_desc, consciousness_desc)
```
