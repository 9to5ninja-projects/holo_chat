Day 7: Creative Problem-Solving and Innovation
=============================================

Building on Day 6's analysis and implementing critical fixes, Day 7 tests:
1. Enhanced content extraction (fixing query echo problem)
2. Creative problem-solving capabilities
3. Innovation and novel solution generation
4. Improved reasoning chains and logical inference
5. Reliable synthesis across multiple domains
