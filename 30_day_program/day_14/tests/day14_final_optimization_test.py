Day 14: Final Optimization and Empirical Validation Test
=======================================================

Building on Day 13's pattern routing breakthrough:
- Pattern fix rate: 83.3% (exceeded 75% target)
- System stability: 100% (excellent)
- Remaining work: 1-2 missing patterns + quality optimization

Focus: Final optimization + empirical validation through session persistence
Goal: Achieve SUCCESS status (80%+ overall) with credible empirical validation

EMPIRICAL VALIDATION APPROACH:
- Session persistence testing (blind test - no suggestion bias)
- One question per session with follow-up in next session
- Cross-session memory and context validation
- Objective measurement of consistency and growth
