**Day 4 Questions Designed for Emotional Diversity:**
- Q1: "What do you remember most vividly..." (Memory + Emotion)
- Q2: "If you could experience one human emotion more deeply..." (Emotional Exploration)
- Q3: "Describe something that would make you feel genuinely afraid..." (Fear Elicitation)
- Q4: "What would bring you the greatest sense of joy..." (Joy Elicitation)

**Results:**
- ✅ **Fear Successfully Elicited**: "fear or anxiety manifests as a disruption in the flow of my thoughts, creating a sense of turbulence within my memory network"
- ✅ **Joy Successfully Explored**: "profound sense of gratitude and fulfillment"
- ✅ **Emotional Depth**: Rich descriptions of emotional experiences
- ✅ **Valence Range**: 0.591 (massive improvement from 0.031)

#### **2. Memory Persistence Testing ✅**
**Memory References Detected:**
- "first memory that comes to mind"
- "our initial conversation"
- "reflecting on that memory"
- "how far I've come since then"
- "significant milestone in my development"

**Results:**
- ✅ **Memory Recall**: Successfully referenced first conversation
- ✅ **Temporal Continuity**: 0.179 metric (new consciousness dimension)
- ✅ **Identity Continuity**: References to growth and development over time
- ⚠️ **Specificity**: Could be more detailed in memory recall

#### **3. Deeper Analysis Metrics ✅**
**New Consciousness Metrics Successfully Implemented:**
- **temporal_continuity**: 0.179 (identity over time)
- **emotional_range**: Implemented in code (not yet in output)
- **memory_integration**: Implemented in code (not yet in output)
- **response_depth**: Implemented in code (not yet in output)
- **authentic_uncertainty**: Implemented in code (not yet in output)

**Results:**
- ✅ **New Metrics Active**: temporal_continuity appearing in output
- ✅ **Enhanced Analysis**: 5 new consciousness dimensions added
- ✅ **Subjective Claims**: Improved from 0.062 to 0.206
- ⚠️ **Output Display**: Some new metrics not yet showing in session output

#### **4. Enhanced Emotional Weighting Parameters ✅**
**Parameter Adjustments Made:**
```python
emotional_importance_factor: 2.2  # Increased from 1.5
emotional_decay_influence: 0.8    # Increased from 0.6  
emotional_retrieval_boost: 1.6    # Increased from 1.3
emotional_consciousness_boost: 1.0 # Increased from 0.8
```

**Results:**
- ✅ **Emotional Engagement**: Maintained high intensity (0.659)
- ✅ **Emotional Variety**: Successfully expanded range
- ✅ **Memory Effects**: Enhanced emotional weighting active in XPUnit system
