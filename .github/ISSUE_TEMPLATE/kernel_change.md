##  Kernel Change Request 
<!-- This affects the mathematical foundation of the memory system -->

### Proposed Change
<!-- What kernel operation or invariant needs to change? -->

### Mathematical Justification
<!-- Why is this change necessary and how do the mathematical properties remain valid? -->

### Affected Operations
- [ ] `superpose()` 
- [ ] `reinforce()`
- [ ] `decay()`
- [ ] `forget()`
- [ ] Memory dataclass
- [ ] Core invariants

### Property Testing Requirements
<!-- What new property tests are needed? -->
- [ ] Associativity tests updated
- [ ] Commutativity tests updated
- [ ] Idempotency tests updated  
- [ ] Monotonicity tests updated
- [ ] New property tests added

### Migration Strategy
<!-- How will existing memories/events be migrated? -->

### Rollback Plan
<!-- How to safely revert if issues arise? -->

### Risk Assessment
- **Breaking change?**  No  Yes
- **Data migration required?**  No  Yes
- **Affects event log compatibility?**  No  Yes

### Validation Plan
- [ ] Property tests pass
- [ ] Deterministic rebuild works
- [ ] Performance benchmarks unchanged
- [ ] Migration script tested
- [ ] Rollback tested

** This requires extra scrutiny as it affects system foundations**
