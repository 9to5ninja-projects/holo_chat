## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES FOR FUTURE ITERATIONS

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Memory Core Restoration**: Partial implementation - vectors load but full reconstruction needs refinement
2. **Performance**: Large memory sets (>1000 units) may need optimization
3. **Emotional Granularity**: Current emotional state restoration could be more detailed

### Technical Debt
1. **Error Handling**: Could be more comprehensive for edge cases
2. **Logging**: More detailed logging for debugging
3. **Configuration**: Some hardcoded values could be configurable
