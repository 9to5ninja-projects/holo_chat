# Emotion Engine Policy Configuration
# This file defines the ethics, bias, and mood parameters for the consciousness system

mood:
  alpha: 0.6      # short-term weight (spikes emotions)
  beta: 0.4       # long-term weight (anchored personality)
  mu_short: 0.25  # short-term EMA speed (how quickly recent emotions affect mood)
  mu_long: 0.03   # long-term EMA speed (how slowly personality changes)

# Intrusion detection parameters (our proven values)
intrusion:
  theta_A: 0.65   # Arousal threshold (higher = less sensitive to emotional spikes)
  theta_T: 0.15   # Topicality threshold (lower = more sensitive to topic changes)
  gamma: 0.5      # Intrusion weight factor
