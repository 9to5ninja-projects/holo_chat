## [0.4.0-beta] - 2025-01-16

### ðŸ§  BREAKTHROUGH: Conversational Memory Architecture

#### Added
- **ConversationalMemoryManager**: Complete short-term memory system with 15-minute decay
- **ConversationalMemoryUnit**: Individual conversational memory units with fast decay
- **Freeze-Frame Loading**: Restore conversation context at session start
- **Intelligent Crystallization**: Automatic conversion of important memories to XPUnits
- **Dual-Decay Mechanics**: Separate decay rates for short-term (15min) and long-term (72hr) memory
- **Working Memory Context**: LLM prompt context generation from conversational memory
- **Enhanced DigitalBrain Integration**: Complete integration with consciousness system
- **Session Persistence**: Save/load conversational memory state
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Full validation of conversational memory features

#### Enhanced
- **DigitalBrain.start_session()**: Now supports freeze-frame loading with previous conversation
- **DigitalBrain.think()**: Enhanced with conversational memory integration and dual-memory architecture
- **DigitalBrain.save_consciousness_state()**: Now includes conversational memory persistence
- **DigitalBrain.load_consciousness_state()**: Now restores conversational memory state
- **LLMInterface**: Enhanced to support conversational context in response generation

#### Fixed
- **Critical Architecture Gap**: Solved missing short-term memory layer between immediate context and persistent XPUnits
- **Conversational Continuity**: Eliminated "amnesia" between sessions
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and decay mechanics for conversational memory

#### Technical Details
