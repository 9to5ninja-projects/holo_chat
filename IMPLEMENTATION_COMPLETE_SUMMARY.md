- Working memory context generation
- Session persistence and restoration

### **Testing Validated ✅**
All core features tested and working:
- Short-term conversational memory: **WORKING**
- Freeze-frame session loading: **WORKING**
- Memory crystallization process: **WORKING**
- Dual-decay mechanics: **WORKING**
- Working memory context: **WORKING**
- Session persistence: **WORKING**

### **Documentation Complete ✅**
- Complete API documentation
- Implementation architecture docs
- Comprehensive changelog
- Updated README with breakthrough features

### **Repository Updated ✅**
- All code committed and pushed
- Version updated to v0.4.0-beta
- 38 files changed, 30,724 insertions
- Complete research analysis included

## 🧠 **The Complete Memory Architecture**

### **Before Implementation**
```
❌ Immediate Context (seconds) → [MISSING LAYER] → Persistent XPUnits (hours/days)
```

### **After Implementation**
```
✅ Immediate Context (seconds) 
    ↓
✅ Conversational Memory (minutes) - NEW! 15-min decay, crystallization
    ↓  
✅ Persistent XPUnits (hours/days) - 72-hour decay, deduplication
    ↓
✅ Consolidated Memory (weeks/months) - Cross-memory relationships
```
