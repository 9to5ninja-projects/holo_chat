MEMORY INTEGRATION PATCH INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Add memory search methods to EmotionXPEnvironment class:
   - search_memory_for_keywords()
   - extract_relevant_details()
   - generate_memory_informed_response()

2. Modify generate_response() method in emotion_engine.py:
   - Before generating template responses, search for relevant memories
   - If relevant memories found, use memory-informed response generation
   - If no memories found, fall back to current template system

3. Update response templates to acknowledge memory retrieval:
   - "I remember you mentioned..."
   - "Based on what you shared earlier..."
   - "Connecting this with our previous conversation..."

4. Add memory consolidation triggers:
   - After several interactions, trigger memory consolidation
   - Combine related memories for better retrieval
   - Update memory importance scores based on retrieval frequency

5. Implement memory-based reasoning:
   - Use stored information to make recommendations
   - Connect new information with existing memories
   - Generate insights based on memory patterns

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
1. Memory search and retrieval (Critical)
2. Memory-informed response generation (Critical)
3. Memory consolidation improvements (Important)
4. Advanced memory reasoning (Future enhancement)
